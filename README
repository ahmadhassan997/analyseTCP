analyseRdb: Utility for analysing tcpdump 
	    sender side traces with regard
	    to latency and loss. 

Prerequisites: cmake pcap

To build: 	enter analyseTCP/build
		run: "cmake .."
		run: make

Example output with a short explanation.
Connection identifiers:
#Src_port: 35260 Dst_port: 9999

Basic statistics:
#Total packets sent: 29307
#Total bytes sent: 11046093
#Average packet size: 376
#Number of retransmissions: 218

Packets with bundled segments is packets that
have larger size because of RDB.
#Number of packets with bundled segments: 23048

We here define loss rate as percentage
of packets that have to be retransmitted using
regular TCP schemes.
#Estimated loss rate: 0.74385%

Bytewise latency is the time before a segment of data 
is acknowledged.
#Bytewise latency - Conn: 35260
#Maximum latency  : 1245ms
#Minimum latency  : 150ms
#Average latency  : 160.856ms
