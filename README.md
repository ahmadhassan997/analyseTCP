analyseTCP
============
A utility for analysing tcpdump traces with regard to latency and loss. It supports analyses with a sender side trace alone as well as with both a sender and receiver side trace.

###Features with only a sender side trace

 * Detailed information about race

   * Packets sent (data/retransmissions,unique bytes) (SYN/FIN/RST)
   * Payload size and latency (ACK time) variance with customizable percentiles.
   * Retransmission count statistics (first/second/third...)
   * DupACK statistics


 * Loss estimation based on retransmissions
 * Saving latency (ACK time) to file for all packets (both aggregated and per stream)

###Features with sender and receiver side traces

 * True loss values based on the data that was received.
 * Calculating the amount of data received by initial transmit, retransmit and RDB.
 * Saving one-way delay variation for the received data. Handles clock skew drifting between sender and receiver hosts.

Loss stats
--------------

### Estimated loss rate based on retransmissions
This is the loss rate estimation based solely on the number of retransmissions. This only relies
on the sender side dump.
We here define loss rate as percentage of packets that have to be retransmitted using regular TCP schemes.

### Receiver side loss stats
These stats rely on both sender and receiver side dump and calculates the exact loss, that is, the bytes that
were sent and not received on the receiver side.

The Ranges Loss does not correspond directly to packets, as the packets may be split after being sent. With no segmentation offloading or segmentation in any nodes between the sender and receiver, the range count should correspond pretty well to the number of packets with unique data.


##Notes

* FIN segments with payload may be counted as two segments.

* Negative packet loss values when analysing sender and receiver dumps

      The packet loss is calculated by (sent packet - received packets).
      When segmentation offloading is enabled on the sender, the sender dump may contain fewer
      packets than the receiver dump. Disabling any segmentation offload features is advised.

##Difference between analyseTCP and tcptrace

Total bytes sent (payload) and Number of retransmitted bytes might differ slightly (2 bytes) from tcptrace, but according to tshark analysetcp is correct:

####Example of how to calculate total sum of tcp payload bytes and retransmitted bytes
    tshark -r trace.dump -qz io,stat,0,"ip.addr==10.0.0.10 && tcp.srcport ==\
    15103","COUNT(tcp.analysis.retransmission)ip.addr==10.0.0.10 && tcp.srcport == 15102 &&\
    tcp.analysis.retransmission","SUM(tcp.len)tcp.len && ip.addr==10.0.0.10 && tcp.srcport ==\
    15102","SUM(tcp.len)tcp.len && ip.addr==10.0.0.10 && tcp.srcport == 15102 && tcp.analysis.retransmission"

####Tests

mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DTESTS=1
